The labyrinth is randomly generated with size 11x11.
The depth-first search algorithm is used to generate the maze. 
The start point and end point are positioned randomly across the maze.
The maze itself has inner and outer walls made of '#'.
It is more of an experimental side-project rather than following the main rules.
